# Flow-WIP-tracker
This application allows you to visualize in-flow times, out-flow times, max waiting time, and Work In Progress (WIP) from a queue. 

It takes 2 lists as inputs (in-flow times and out-flow times) and plots a graph using Matplotlib.

To execute, run:
- try.py small
- try.py large [integer number of units]
